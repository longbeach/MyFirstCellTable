Just a very basic GWT project to display a table with a sortable column, based on the CellTable and SimplePager elements.
The code is mostly based on the official GWT tutorial :
http://code.google.com/intl/en/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiCellTable.html 

I left the RPC service (GreetingService) created by the sample project. It is not used.

The demo is here :

Only the column VILLE is sortable !
